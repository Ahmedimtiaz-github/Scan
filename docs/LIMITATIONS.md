LIMITATIONS & DEMO FALLBACKS
CPU-only runs are slow: expect tens of seconds to many minutes per generated image depending on CPU, resolution, and steps.

Recommended baseline for acceptance test: 4 CPU cores + 16 GB RAM.

For high-quality demos, use free cloud resources (Google Colab). Provide Colab instructions in the future.

This repo currently contains integration scaffolding (placeholders). Replace perception and generation placeholders with Batool & Zohaib modules.
